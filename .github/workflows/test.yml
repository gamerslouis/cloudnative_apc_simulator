# Description:
#   - Unit test
#   I use https://github.com/nektos/act to test this action file locally.
#   Notice that testing stage needs to use node version >= 12,
#   since the globalThis does not support in lower version.
#
#   - Dockerize
#   I use https://github.com/docker/build-push-action
#   to build and push this app to docker hub which owns by WaterSo.
#   
#   - CommitHelm
#   I use https://github.com/cpina/github-action-push-to-another-repository
#   to trigger copy job to another repository for helm chart
